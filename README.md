**Note:** this is a fork of the
[upstream bosonic](https://github.com/steinbrecher/bosonic),
ported to Python 3.

Bosonic is a library developed for the simulation of photonic systems
whose inputs are indistinguishable bosons (in the case of the authors'
interest, photons). In particular, it focuses on the rapid computation
of the multi-particle transfer functions for these systems and
supports computation of the gradient of a cost function with respect
to the system parameters. It was originally developed for the
devleopment of our Quantum Optical Neural Networks [1] and contains
specialized functionality for their simulation and optimization.

Key focuses of this library were two-fold:

1. Speed: Key functionality is written in optimized Cython with
   support for OpenMP threading
2. Pervasive autograd support: We rely heavily on the use of the
   Autograd [1] library for gradient computation and efficient
   optimization of system parameters. Wherever optimized forward-pass
   functions are written in Cython, there should be explicit support for
   autograd coded as well. This is not currently universally true, but
   there is support for all major functions.

# Key Functionality

## Multi-particle Unitary Evolution

The core motivation for this package was the rapid computation of the
multi-particle unitary transform as a function of the single particle
unitary and the number of bosonic inputs. That is, if we have a four
dimensional unitary U, and we know there are 3 photons at the input,
we want to know the transformation over the `binom(4+3-1, 3)`dimensional basis `[3,0,0,0], [2,1,0,0], [2,0,1,0], ...` etc.

This is supported by the function `bosonic.aa_phi`, which is named
after Aaronson and Arkhipov, who specified the form of this function
that we use as their Î¦(U) function in [2]. For example, we can
demonstrate the famous Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with a beamsplitter:

```python
>>> import bosonic as b
>>> from numpy import array
>>> U = array([[1, 1], [1, -1]], dtype=complex) / np.sqrt(2)
>>> phiU = b.aa_phi(U, 2)
>>> phiU
array([[ 0.5       +0.j,  0.70710678+0.j,  0.5       +0.j],
       [ 0.70710678+0.j,  0.        +0.j, -0.70710678+0.j],
       [ 0.5       +0.j, -0.70710678+0.j,  0.5       +0.j]])
>>> b.fock.basis(2,2)
[[2, 0], [1, 1], [0, 2]]
>>> inp = array([[0], [1], [0]], dtype=complex)
>>> phiU@inp
array([[ 0.70710678+0.j],
       [ 0.        +0.j],
       [-0.70710678+0.j]])
>>> abs(phiU@inp)**2
array([[0.5],
       [0. ],
       [0.5]])
```

Here, we build the unitary corresponding to a 50/50 beamsplitter in U.
As shown the line after we print phiU, the basis here is [2, 0], [1,
1], and [0, 2]. So the state corresponding to one photon incident at
each of the inputs is [0, 1, 0]. In the final line, two lines, we see
that the output is an equal superposition over two photons at one
output and two photons at the other, with no probability of the
photons leaving by different ports.

## Quantum Optical Neural Networks

As described in [1], we've developed a proposed architecture for
quantum optical neural networks that involves tiling arbitrary unitary
transformations with single-site nonlinearities. See the paper for
more details, but here's a visual summary of the architecture:

# Installation

Installing Bosonic should be done as follows (using your preferred
python package manager instead of `pip`, if desired):

```shell
$ pip install Cython numpy scipy numba
$ pip install git+https://github.com/flaport/bosonic
```

On Mac, you'll need gcc from homebrew and libopenmp as well:

```shell
$ brew install gcc
$ brew install libomp
$ pip install Cython numpy scipy numba
$ CC=gcc-8 pip install git+https://github.com/flaport/bosonic
```

You can check if `bosonic` is installed correctly by running pytest:

```shell
$ pip install pytest
$ pytest tests/
```
